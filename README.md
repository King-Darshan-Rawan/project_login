# Webpage Website Login and Register Page

Welcome to the Webpage Website project_login repository! This repository contains the source code for a simple login and register page designed for a webpage website.

## Features

- **User Registration**: New users can create an account by providing a username and password.
- **User Authentication**: Registered users can securely log in using their username and password.
- **Validation**: Input fields are validated to ensure data integrity and prevent common security vulnerabilities.
